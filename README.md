# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room has ordered a web-based game that need to be capable of running on various platforms. “Draw It or Lose It” is the name of the game that is only designed to run on android OS. Different teams consisting of several people compete in four rounds that each is limited to one minute. The game is run in this way: one picture is taken out of the gallery and one of the teams guesses in the allocated time. If the first team cannot guess correctly, other competing team members have a chance until 15 seconds is over
# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Describing every step, in detail and explaining both advantages and disadvantages of each option
# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It is extremely helpful to plan, create a design and then start coding; without a design document, unnecessary steps, processes, and action may be taken, impacting productivity, efficiency, and cost of the project. The design document may change multiple times during the project; however, it provides a solid framework for the project.
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Spending more time in designing document and get more in-depth information about customer’s need, available technologies that could be offered and the top solutions
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The best way to understand user’s need is good communication and making sure that we are on the same page. If there is any doubt, it is better to ask, compared to finishing the project and then realizing that customer needed something totally different.
# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Good understanding of customer’s need is essential, and I make sure that I realize those needs by repeating customer’s needs to them in my own words and asking them to confirm or correct me, to eliminate any confusion. That way I can make sure where the focus should be. The other important factor for me is to separate modules and functionality of the application using the agile methodology, to make upgrade, edits and maintenance of the software easier.
